1. Entity Identification

```
I am designing a database. Help me identify all the entities based on the given requirements.

Requirements: """
The database needs to maintain records of all spaceship brands and models, manufactured spaceships, dealers, customers, and relationships between dealers and customers.
A spaceship brand is associated with multiple models, and a model is associated with multiple spacecrafts. 
A dealer is distributed one or more spaceships, and serves one or more customers. 
A customer is served by one or more dealer, and is associated with one or more spaceships that he or she has bought from dealers.
A spaceship is associated with one model, can be associated with no more than one owners, and no more than one dealers.
"""
```

2. Attribute Identification

```
I am designing a database for a manufacturer of spaceships. I have identified five entities, including brand, model, spaceship, dealer, and customer. Help me identify attributes and the primary key per entity based on the given requirements. Generate output using the desired format.

Desired format: 
Entity name: spaceship
Attributes:
Serial number - CHAR(17)
Recommended price – NUMERIC(8, 2)
Primary key: Serial number

Requirements: """
A brand has a name. The number of brands is limited and smaller than 5.
A model has a 4-digit number and name. The number is unique per model.
A spaceship has a 17-digit serial number (like a VIN number for a car), a recommended price, and a year number. The serial number is unique per spaceship. The unit for the recommended price is USD. The year number represents the year in which the spaceship is manufactured.
A dealer has a name, address, phone number, email address, and dealer website URL. The dealer may be anywhere on Earth.
A customer has a name, address, phone number, and email address. Multiple customers may share the same address. The customer may live anywhere on Earth.
"""
```

Add requirements to formatting:

```
Regenerate your answer using a new format but the same requirements. Make sure that names of entities and attributes are all snake cased. 

New format: 
Entity name of Spaceship: spaceship
Attributes:
Serial number: serial_number - CHAR(17)
Recommended price: recommended_price – NUMERIC(8, 2)
Primary key: serial_number

8. Optimization

Q1:

```
Applying a check constraint to country attribute in the address table is painful because there are about 200 countries in the world. what's a common and recommended approach to store such information without this constraint but still retains the data validity check?
```

Q2:

```
To ensure the validity of the country code of phone numbers in the customer/address tables, what's a common and recommended approach to store such information?
```
